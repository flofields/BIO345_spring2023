# Goal - to learn how to make standard curve and extrapolate data 

#Part I - Question: What is the maximum absorbance of the “pigment” (food coloring)?

#I suggest creating an excel or google sheet file with two rows "wavelength" and "Absorbance" then importing the file in R Studio. 
#You can then use the R script from assignment 1 to create a plot. Use the four box recipe to determine what plot you could graph. 
#No statistical test is necessary for this part.

#Part II- Question: What is the relationship between the Absorbance (at the wavelength identified above) and the food color concentration?

#First you need to first import your data. Some of you imported your data from google sheets so I included the script for that too
Lab2_Data <- read.csv("Inserts name of csv file") 
#or
library(googlesheets4)
Lab2_Data <- read_sheet('Inserts google sheets link')


#If you are plotting your graph in R studio you need to install these packages first 
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages ("tidyverse")
install.packages ("ggplot2")
install.packages ("readr")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("gridExtra")
install.packages("grid")
install.packages("lattice")
install.packages("Rmisc")


library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(Rmisc)

#The Google Sheets has both the unknown and standard samples so you will have to subset the data to obtain only the standard samples
standard_curve <- Lab2_Data %>% 
  filter(Sample.Type == "Standard") 

#Plotting your standard curve graph


Standard_Curve_Plot<- ggplot(data = standard_curve, aes(x=Concentration, y=Absorbance)) + #plotting standard curve
  ylab("Absorbance (nm)")+ xlab("Concentration") + #axis labels
  geom_point()+ #points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + #add line
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
                     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

lmstandard <- lm (Concentration ~ Absorbance, data = standard_curve) #creating linear model
lmsummary <- summary(lmstandard) #summarizing model

#OR


model <-lm(Concentration ~ Absorbance, data=Standard_Curve_Plot) #runs a linear regression
coe <- coef(model) #extracts the coeffecients (values needed for the slope of a line equation)
R2 <-summary(model)$r.squared
plot(Concentration ~ Absorbance, data=Standard_Curve_Plot)
abline(lm(Concentration ~ Absorbance, data=Standard_Curve_Plot))
summary(model)


#Part III - Question: What are the rust tide concentrations at the different sites? 

samples <- Lab2_Data %>% #subsetting Samples
  filter(Sample.Type == "Sample") 

samples$Concentration.calc <- predict(lmstandard, newdata = samples) #This line of code uses the model to get concentrations of the unknowns.

#The statistical test you will be using for part three will be the ANOVA test.
#There is a link below I suggest you use to help with your understanding of what this test is used for.
